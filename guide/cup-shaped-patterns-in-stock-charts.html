            <h2>ComfyInvestor's Guide to Cup Shaped Stock Chart Patterns</h2>
            <hr>
            <div class='container'>
                <p>Much like the general stock market will consolidate periodically, individual stocks will consolidate as well. These consolidations, or “corrections,” are completely normal and happen quite frequently on different scales.</p>



                KEY TAKEAWAYS
                Cups can vary drastically in size and shape, so being able to identify healthy ones is important.
                Don’t forget about the volume chart.
                Wait for a proper buy point.
                Just because a cup is unhealthy, that doesn’t mean you should avoid purchasing that stock at a proper buy-point.



                The cup pattern is the most common chart pattern of all of them. This is simply because a cup represents a general correction in the price of a stock without any additional features or modifications to the general pattern. Because this type of shape is so frequent, cups can vary drastically in size and shape. Knowing how to identify a healthy cup shape is the foundation of stock chart analysis.

                Let’s Play Good Cup, Bad Cup

                A healthy cup has certain key characteristics that you should look for. When identifying a proper cup formation, the length should be between 7 and 65 weeks. However, a typical cup pattern will usually last between 12 and 48 weeks. Additionally, you want to look for a pattern that undergoes a correction anywhere from 12 to 33 percent. Any more, and your cup might be displaying symptoms of something more than just a normal price correction. If your pattern consolidates less than 12 percent, your pattern can still be healthy, it just won’t be considered a cup.

                The general shape of the pattern is important, too. Look for cups that are shaped more like a curved “U” rather than a sharp “V” pattern. The smoother transition generally signals accumulation of shares by institutions and like-minded investors. Without it, there might not have been enough time for accumulation, and the cup becomes at-risk for additional consolidation.

                A CUP PATTERN IS ONLY AS HEALTHY AS ITS PRIOR UPTREND.

                Similar in importance, a cup pattern is only as healthy as its prior uptrend. Look for patterns that are preceded by a steady climb in price by at least 30% from the previous breakout or bottom. Without a proper prior uptrend, your subsequent cup pattern may be part of a different, larger pattern. Or even worse, a premature consolidation might be a sign of weakness in the stock or the general market.

                Pump Up The Volume

                Now that you know about the general price chart pattern of a healthy cup, it’s important to understand the role of the volume chart. If the price pattern of a proper cup is like shooting a free throw with perfect form in basketball, then the volume chart of that pattern is like making several free throws with perfect form. In other words, you can’t really say that you’re a good free throw shooter unless you’ve made a lot of them, and you can’t say a cup pattern looks good unless the volume chart looks good, as well.

                WE WANT TO SEE A NATURAL CORRECTION, NOT A FIRE SALE.

                On that note, here are some important volume chart characteristics that you should look out for. During a prior uptrend, it’s important to have some above average volume trading periods. This brings legitimacy to the uptrend and helps ensure that the ensuing cup pattern is simply a needed correction rather than a sign of some underlying problems with the stock.

                As for the cup pattern itself, it’s natural to see some higher volume trading while the price is consolidating, but watch out for prolonged periods of this. We want to see a natural correction, not a fire sale. Similarly, while the stock is building the right side of the cup, we’d like to see an uptick in volume. It’s not necessary, but it indicates more substantiated, institutional trading. In addition, it’s encouraging to see small periods of “light and tight” trading during the cup formation, particularly towards the bottom of the cup pattern. Periods with low trading volume, narrow price ranges, and closely-priced closes over a few weeks indicate institutional accumulation.

                You Break It, You Buy It

                Buy low, sell high. Right? Well, sort of. It’s true that we want to purchase stocks at a lower price than when we eventually sell them, but we don’t want to buy just because they’re priced relatively lower than previously. In the short-term, it’s best to build positions in a stock when it is showing strength, not when it is tanking.

                For cups, the best price to buy is 10 cents above the previous high of the cup. Again, we want to purchase a stock when it is showing strength, and we also want to make sure that it properly breaks out of the cup pattern, thus the 10 cent cushion. Figure 1 shows the weekly chart for Paycom Software. Notice the 3 cup patterns (and the partial cup) displayed alongside with their 5% buy regions. By waiting to buy at the proper buy point, you increase the likelihood of short-term gains.

                Oppositely, not all stories have a happy ending. Investors who were anxious to build a position in Twitter in March 2016 (see Figure 2) might have been tempted to purchase stock prior to the proper buy point of the cup pattern that was forming. Needless to say, those investors were greatly disappointed as the stock proceeded to lose 70% of its market capitalization. Wait for the buy point.

                The buy point is a position of strength, but additionally, breakouts generally occur in conjunction with some type of major event. Whether that’s a quarterly earnings report, updated sales numbers, a merger or acquisition, or even an analyst initiating coverage, a breakout corresponding with an important news event gives the breakout credibility.

                YOU’RE BUILDING A HYPOTHESIS USING PRICE AND VOLUME PATTERNS.

                Buying stock is more about the scientific method than understanding business models or unnecessarily complicated technical indicators. You’re building a hypothesis using price and volume patterns (and the understanding of how the stock market has behaved, historically). So the more information you can put into your model (i.e. waiting for the buy point), the more accurate that model will be.

                With that said, just because a stock doesn’t have a perfectly healthy cup or isn’t at a proper buy point, that doesn’t mean that you can’t purchase it. Simply put, it means you’ll have a lower probability for a successful breakout. Remember, less information means lower odds, but it doesn’t mean that a breakout is impossible. So keep that in mind and happy investing!
